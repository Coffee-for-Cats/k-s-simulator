# K&S
It's an assembly-like language created for learning purposes. There was already an complex interpreter, but the dificulty of use inspired me to build this site.

## Why this exists
  ### Advantages:
  - Copy/Paste (usefull if the teacher wants to run your code).
  - Faster and Instant execution options.
  - Avaliability on Mobile.
  - Corrected input bug (you needed to refresh the page randomly, having to rewrite your code each time).

  ### Drawbacks:
  - Can't really see the circuit working.
  - Is hosted by me.

`All the code was written and hosted by me on first semester.`
